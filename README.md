# Description

After being mistreated in another game, where it was forced to crash into pipes over and over again, our brave little chick is back... and ready for revenge! This time, the feathered hero won't fly defenseless: now it throws knives to defeat the enemies trying to stop it from all sides of the screen.

Get ready for fast-paced action and fun as you help the chick unleash its fury on waves of enemies. Revenge has never been so sweet or so dangerous!
